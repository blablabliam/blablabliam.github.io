<h1> Deep Projects </h1>

<h2>Metronome Table</h2>

<p>Built a table that synchronizes wind up metronomes set around the same frequency by apply a force on metronomes that are not exactly in sync with the rhythm of the table. Demonstrated at the 2016 Physics Festival.</p>

<p><a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v5eBf2KwF8">This is an example of a similar table in use.</a></p>

<h2>Magnon Demo</h2>

<p>Built a platform of compasses that realign with a switching magnetic field. The magnetic field was generated by a set of wires with 1 amp activated by an arduino and MOSFET transistors. Demonstrated at the 2017 Physics Festival.</p>

<h2>Terrella, the Aurora Borealis Demo</h2>

<p>The Terrella is a demonstration of the Northern Lights, caused by interaction between the sun and the upper ionosphere. The terrella I built uses a 5 kV power supply run into a vacuumed bell jar through a fast burn fuse. The high voltage causes an electron beam to flow to a grounded, metalic, magnetic sphere, where the beam of fast moving electrons is manipulated by the magnetic field around the magnet. The beam will take several forms bassed on the voltage between the sphere and wire. At low voltages (500 V) the beam will cause a bow shock around the front of the sphere. This bow shock is made of ionized low pressure atmosphere, primarily nitrogen, and glows blueish purple. Different mixes can be added to change the color, and since the upper atmoshphere is primarily oxygen and ozone, these gasses would show a greenish color like the Aurora. At higher voltages (5000 V) the beam becomes visible and a bright point forms on the sphere. This point will precess and move around the pole of the magnet, similar to the Aurora. The beam also visibly curves through space. The project is still in progress, but was demonstrated successfully at the 2018 Physics Festival.</p>

The vacuum hose can be see falling off the table to an oil pump, and a 5 kV power supply sits on the table. The plexiglass shield is to protect any viewers from a bell jar failure.">
