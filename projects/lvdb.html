Local Volume Database
</h1>

<p> The local volume database is an SQL database containing structure, kinematics, distance, chemistry and proper motion data about the dwarf galaxies and globular clusters in the local volume, out to 3 Mpc.
The database provides a snapshot of the current research on the local volume, allowing users to test their data and compare it to previous findings. I am working on the database with John Maner, Andrew Pace 
(A&M), Alex Drilca-Wagner and others at Fermilab.</p>

<p> This is a poster John and I made to present at the Undergraduate Summer Research Poster Session, August 1st 2018.</p>
