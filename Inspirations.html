<h1>Inspirations</h1>

<h2>Arago on the Eclispe of 1836</h2>

<p> The hour of the commencement
of the eclipse drew nigh. More than twenty thousand persons, with
smoked glasses in their hands, were examining the radiant globe projected upon an
azure sky. Although armed with our powerful telescopes , we had hardly begun to
discern the small notch on the western limb of the Sun, when an immense exclamation,
formed by the blending together of twenty thousand different voices,
announced to us that we had anticipated by only a few seconds the observation
made with the unaided eye by twenty thousand astronomers equipped for the occasion,
whose first essay this was. A lively curiosity, a spirit of emulation, the desire
of not being outdone, had the privilege of giving to the natural vision an unusual
power of penetration. During the interval that elapsed between this moment and the
almost total disappearance of the Sun we remarked nothing worthy of relation in
the countenances of so many spectators. But when the Sun, reduced to a very narrow
filament, began to throw upon the horizon only a very feeble light, a sort of
uneasiness seized upon all; every person felt a desire to communicate his impressions
to those around him. Hence arose a deep murmur, resembling that sent forth
by the distant ocean after a tempest. The hum of voices increased in intensity as the
solar crescent grew more slender; at length the crescent disappeared, darkness suddenly
succeeded light, and an absolute silence marked this phase of the eclipse with
as great precision as did the pendulum of our astronomical clock. The phenomenon
in its magnificence had triumphed over the petulance of youth, over the levity
which certain persons assume as a sign of superiority, over the noisy indifference
of which soldiers usually make profession. A profound stillness also reigned in the
air; the birds had ceased to sing. After an interval of solemn expectation, which
lasted about two minutes, transports of joy, shouts of enthusiastic applause, saluted
with the same accord, the same spontaneous feeling, the first reappearance of the
rays of the Sun. To a condition of melancholy produced by sentiments of an indefinable
nature there succeeded a lively and intelligible feeling of satisfaction which
no one sought to escape from or moderate the impulses of. To the majority of the
public the phenomenon had arrived at its term. The other phases of the eclipse had
few attentive spectators beyond the persons devoted especially to astronomical
pursuits.”</p>

<h2>Corona and Coronet, Mabel Loomis Todd, Chapter 29</h2>

<p>It was as if the hand of Deity had been visibly laid upon
space and worlds, to allow one momentary glimpse of the awfulness of creation.</p>

<h2>Leslie Peltier on R Leo</h2>

<p>"...every March first since that night, whenever the skies were clear, R Leonis and
 I have recalled our first meeting by making a mutual estimate of our brightness" (Peltier 1999)</p>

<h2>Margaret Atwood, The Year of the Flood</h2>

<p>“Mushrooms were the roses in the garden of that unseen world, because the real mushroom plant was underground. The parts you could see - what most people called a mushroom - was just a brief apparition. A cloud flower.”</p>
