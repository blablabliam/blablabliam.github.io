								<b>DIY Muon Detectors</b><br>Scintillator and Geiger-Muller based muon detectors for use in amateur particle telescopes. With these, I hope to create the world's first amateur particle telescope network. I gave a talk on the subject for the Rockford Amateur Astronomers in 2021, and have gathered data with my latest detector based on the MIT Cosmic Watch detector design. Future developments planned are incorporating IoT into the detector so that many units can be operated on a large scale. The network will hunt for global cosmic ray anomalies, similar to the CRAYFIS and CREDO detector networks.
