<h1>Project List</h1>

<h2>Astro:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Test Autoguider camera and test limits of untracked images.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Tried it, but the images were not very noteworthy. Scrapping that idea until I can afford a tracking mount.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Do another transit curve:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Became an observer for AAVSO, anticipating taking my first visual data soon. Shooting for R Leo as my first; was dead on the middle of the value range for that night.</li>
		<li>Success! I need to invest in a printer so I can print the charts, and not blind myself with a screen each time I look at the chart.</li>
		<li>At this point, I have done quite a few more visual observations of variables. My observer code is PLLA.</li>
		<li>I haved started investing in a real imaging setup. Right now, I am using a RASA 8 with a ZWO ASI1600MM camera on a Mach 1 mount. I also have some filters coming in. This should be perfect for imaging transits with fast exposures for a detailed curve. </li>
		<li>Filters came in, and I moved up to a AP1100 mount on George's permenant pier. I also finished the custom cables for the dew heaters and coolers, which should improve s/n by quite a bit. </li>
		<li>Upgraded the Dobsonian with some cinder block stands and a chair, so I can stay off of the ground. Easily the best upgrade I have made. </li>
	</ul>
	<li>Meteorite hunting.</li>
	<li>Micrometeorite analysis:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Standard Microscope</li>
		<li>Slides</li>
		<li>Found a possible match from samples taken in my truck bed, but cannot confirm. I need to get more samples at some point. Maybe I can convince George to let me put a collection dish on his property.</li>
		<li>Came up with a good idea for collecting the micrometeorites. I need a collection dish, some tubing and some magnets. This would let me separate the micrometeorites by magnetization/mass in the collector. </li>
	</ul>
	<li>Liquid metal primary mirror.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Liquid metal alloy, like Mercury, Gallium or Galinstan.</li>
		<li>Rotating pan with variable speed.</li>
		<li>Frame with a movable light detector.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Galileo replica telescope.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Glass Lenses</li>
		<li>Rolled Brass Tube</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Wide Binary Statistical Approach in SDSS</li>
	<ul>
		<li>In college, I was supposed to confirm this paper using updated data. I had to discontinue the project due to other needs at the time, but now I think would be a good time to revisit the project.</li>
		<li>Current progress is in a github, found here: <a href="https://github.com/blablabliam/widebinaries">Wide Binaries Github</a>. I will open access when the project is complete. </li> 
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Physics:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Build a new muon detector with the MIT recipe:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Full parts list at http://www.cosmicwatch.lns.mit.edu/about </li>
		<li>Ordered all parts for doing to builds, need to sit down and assemble them.</li>
		<li>Fully assembled the boards and need to do testing. Current concerns that the detector is working and the counter is not need to be addressed with an oscilliscope, which I do not have yet. </li>
		<li>Makerspace has an oscope now, so I can try out the detector with that soon.</li>
		<li>Detected particles! I reflowed the SiPM in the reflow oven, and detected particle signals on the oscilliscope. Need to connect to the arduino circuit.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Build a new muon telescope:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Pair of muon detectors and coincidence circuit: Need to finish making one detector first!</li>
		<li>Slewing platform: Currently have access to a Mach 1 mount, which would work great for the project.</li>
		<li>Maybe using a DIY mount like the 3D printed arduino ones would be acceptable for this, to save money.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Muon Detector Array</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Using the Omega2, I could make IP accessible particle detectors. From there, working with an organization like an astronomy club, I could make a cosmic ray array of fairly large scale.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Build the spectrometer, for liquid samples and the telescope:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>3d printed frame</li>
		<li>Android app for analysis.</li>
		<li>First Surface mirrors from CD players and disk drives</li>
		<li>I have the main body done, but need to redesign for the better mirrors. Also, the angle of the mirror is too sharp and needs to be adjusted. </li>
	</ul>
	<li>Graphene Supercapacitor build.</li>
	<li>Railgun with modern superconductors.</li>
	<li>Lightning rocket.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Small model rockets</li>
		<li>1000m of very thin wire</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Aragoscope with 3d printed zone plate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Biology:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Study Illinois taxonomy.</li>
	<li>Start a Prairie Restoration Guidebook.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Started it, will add more when I can go back to work.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Potato foods cornucopia!</li>
	<li>Mushrooms:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>First try with Oysters didn't work. Tried to use plastic ziplock bags and Starbucks coffee grounds, but grew mold on the mycelium.</li>
		<li>Second try used jars and made more attempt at sterility by swabbing everything in rubbing alchohol, but still grew mold eventually.</li>
		<li>For the third try, I want to try and use a heater setup to maintain temp. My apartment is just too cold to grow them without having a dedicated heater.</li>
		<li>VICTORY: went all in on sterilization. Process write up will be done later, but I now have 6 jars of spawn in my incubator.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Astrobotany Grow Challenge with NASA! https://www.instructables.com/contest/beyondEarth/</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Thermistors</li>
		<li>Arduino</li>
		<li>OLED Screen</li>
		<li>Chlorella (harvested and isolated some Chlorella of an unknown species at the pond in my bioreactor, didn't use for this project)</li>
		<li>LED Panels</li>
		<li>DC Arduino Motor</li>
		<li>Hydration Sensor</li>
		<li>Grow Medium. I chose the Root Riot plugs from a local hyddroponics shop.</li> 
	</ul>
	<li>Results are here! https://www.instructables.com/id/Lettuce-Growing-Module/ While I did not win, I still have a great lettuce grow box for my desk!</li>
	<li>Bioreactor:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Made a basic photobioreactor with a few water bottles, a lamp, and an air pump for aquariums.</li>
		<li>Upgraded to use a sterilized kitty litter tub that holds more than eight liters of water, and built a glass air hose with tubing.</li>
		<li>Isolated Chlorella from Rock Cut by leaving pond scum in a container for 5 months alternating freezing and room temp without allowing more air to enter.
		Over time, all non-plant life died, and I was left with Spyrogyra, Diatoms, and Chlorella. Used fractional dillution to separate the species out, and put the Chlorella into the large bioreactor. I have used Miracle Grow and hydroponic fertilizers, and found better results with the hydroponic fertilizer.</li>
		<li>Project sidelined for the time being since the heating for the bioreactor was not sufficient, and would cost considerable power during the winter.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Chemistry:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Test gold platings for implantation project.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Beakers: got plenty now.</li>
		<li>Etching Solution</li>
		<li>Neodymium Magnets: ordered a bunch.</li>
		<li>Need gold salts.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Potassium Nitrate from banana peels.</li>
	<li>Crystal Growing:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Copper II Sulfate Crystals worked pretty well, but I need to try using a higher purity of fluid.</li>
		<li>Copper crystals on the electroplater at the Makerspace are going well! They take a very long time to grow.</li>
		<li>NaCl Crystals were a success. Grew around 20 crystals with good cubic shape, with good clarity!</li>
		<li>Copper acetate crystals would be good to make for electroplating. I can get free copper from the Makerspace, and by adding concentrated vinegar copper acetate will form.</li>
		<li>I need a better grow chamber, though. I am looking at mounting computer fans into my dry ice storage box and using that as a growth chamber.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- <li>Start a Prairie Restoration Guidebook.</li>-->
</ul>

<h2>Geology:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Take a rockhounding expidition in Illinois.</li>
	<ul>
